Find-s Algorithm :

1. Load Data set
2. Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
3. For each positive training instance x
          â€¢ For each attribute constraint ai in h
                  If the constraint ai in h is satisfied by x then do nothing
                  else replace ai in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x
4. Output hypothesis h
